SabiraSeal™ — Owner-centric Authentication for Luxury Fashion 

Version 2.1
Author: Sabira Banfa, Founder, Sabira Banfa Atelier
Date: 5-10-2025

SabiraSeal™ is the world’s first owner-centric authentication system for luxury fashion, art, and collectibles. Unlike traditional authentication methods that focus only on verifying items, SabiraSeal™ ties each piece directly to its verified owner. This creates a new category; owner-linked authentication that transforms luxury ownership into a visible, prestigious, and verifiable experience.


	Background & Problem

Luxury has always been about more than material value—it’s about legacy, story, and status. But today’s market faces deep challenges:

•Counterfeiting & plagiarism by fast fashion and fraudulent operators.

•Mass-market dilution, eroding exclusivity and perceived value.

•Ownership ambiguity; existing authentication verifies products, not people.

This gap fuels fraud, undermines collectors’ confidence, and weakens brand integrity.


	Solution: SabiraSeal™

SabiraSeal™ is a consumer-facing, owner-centric verification system designed for both new and secondary luxury markets.
	
•Verified Ownership: Each luxury item is linked to its rightful owner, creating immutable provenance.
	
•Fraud Prevention: Mitigates counterfeit resale and stolen goods circulation.

•Visible Prestige: Ownership is not hidden in a backend,it’s part of the status experience.

•Category Creation: Introduces owner-linked authentication as a new standard.

•Blockchain Agnostic: Compatible with multiple chains, offering brands flexibility.


	Category Creation: A New Standard

Authentication systems have always been brand- or item-centric. SabiraSeal™ is the first to shift the axis to the owner. By defining this new language and framework, SabiraSeal™ doesn’t compete within the existing authentication landscape,it creates the landscape.
